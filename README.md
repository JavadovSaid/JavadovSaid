Data Analyst with a strong foundation in economics, focused on turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.

I work at the intersection of data analytics, statistics, and business thinking—using data not just to describe what happened, but to support better decisions and smarter strategies.

I have hands-on experience with SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, working on data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and basic modeling. My economics background helps me understand context: markets, incentives, risk, and trade-offs behind the numbers.

I’m particularly interested in exploratory data analysis, econometrics, and risk-related problems, where data meets real-world uncertainty. I value clarity over complexity and focus on insights that are practical, explainable, and useful.

I’m a continuous learner, actively improving my technical and analytical skills, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge my thinking and expand my perspective. I’m open to collaborative, data-driven environments where analysis is taken seriously and results matter.
